    - Fixed issues with generated images (fonts and layouts)
    - Fixed several issues surrounding legends, which we now draw

      the intervening area with NaN values (i.e. a hole is plotted).
    - Documentation and small fixes are the only remaining issues.

kmchart 1.0.0Beta7 (15 November 2007)
    - Record mode work, automatic Tab creation for replay is now
      working well.

kmchart 1.0.0Beta6 (8 November 2007)
    - Modification to the time interval in kmtime now does the right
      thing in kmchart.
    - Several difficult time control issues resolved - fast fwd and
      high speed play now work well.

      Filesys, PMCD, Syscalls, Paging, Overview, Sockets, Cisco,
      ShpingCPU, ShpingElapsed
    - new GNUmakefile wrappers to work around Makefile being rebuilt
      by Qt Designer

      instance domains (see the Filesys view)

    - fix small botch in 0.4 release

kmchart 0.4
[released 28 Feb 2006 on http://sourceforge.net/projects/pcpaddons]
    - view (config) parser added, so can now load user and systems views,
      supporting both the old pmchart syntax and some kmchart improvements
    - QA suite created (more pcpqa for the fans)
    - small PCP 2.5.0 patch with just the required libpmc changes
    - better handling of minimum size and resizing
    - for New->Plot, default style is always Line (inheriting the
      default from the previous chart was just plain wrong)
    - handle pmchart syntax for instance or pattern in view config
      file (no quotes, use text to end of line), as well as kmchart syntax
      (instance identifiers enclosed in quotes)
    - %h expands to hostname in chart title
    - one timer for all charts (as opposed to one time for each chart), so
      all time axes are temporally correlated (reduced memory footprint as
      a side effect)
    - plot color shown as a block in the legend for improved usability
    - Edit->Delete->chart implemented
    - current chart highlighted with color change for axes and titles
      (black->red)
    - improved top-level re-sizing logic

      at this stage
    - Help->About implemented
    - Edit->Colors implemented
    - Autoscaling logic fixed up so it actually works now
    - Loadavg and CPU as first views

kmchart 0.3
[released 17 Jan 2006 on http://sourceforge.net/projects/pcpaddons]
    - move Qwt base from 4.2 to 5.0 beta (20050831 at this stage)
    - add to current and create new chart both functional in MetricSelection
      dialog
    - metrics really being fetched using libpcp_pmc methods ... real data
      values being used for plots
    - complete overhaul for the APIs to the Chart and Plot classes
    - fixed y-axis scaling dialog behaviour
    - Edit->Colors ... implemented
    - plot data arrays allocated dynamically (in preparation for *History
      changes on command line and via UI)
    - common x-axis time data across all charts and single timer thread
      so all charts updated at the same time
    - initial support for left-mouse selection of "current" chart in a
      multi-chart configuration ... and some visible feedback (title and
      y-axis label appear in red)
    - update interval specified via -t on command line
    - initial view loading support through -c config on command line (hack
      to load hard-coded CPU view, i.e. no view config file parser,
      at the moment to demonstrate completeness of API into the Chart
      and Plot classes
    - initial #-cycle support for default color rotation for plots within
      a chart
    - pale blue rather than grey for the plot canvas background
    - rudimentary chart resizing with outer window resizing
    - full support for Stack, Util, Area and Line plots, including changing
      style on the fly via the UI
    - add support for Legend labels as alternative to the default metric
      specification being used (enhancement over pmchart) 
    - make MetricSelection dialog modeless
    - added File->Print support
    - added Help->About support
    - graph Title and Legend manipulation in the UI works now
    - changing host/archive source in MetricSelection does not keep adding
      the same hosts/archives to the selection list ... and the PMNS
      transition now appears to be correct
    - instance domains for archive contexts are loaded using
      pmGetIndomArchive() rather than pmGetIndom() to remove any temporal
      dependency in the possible instances

kmchart 0.2 [mailed out 4 Jan 2006]
    - added plot legend handling (a la the Qwt bode example with some
      enhancements)

      show/hide function of the plot Legend

      the associated data into the Graph class
