PCP GUI

pmchart is designed to produce stripcharts from Performance Co-Pilot (PCP)
performance metrics fetched from live sources (one or more pmcd hosts) and
also historical sources (one or more PCP archives).

pmtime is a graphical time controller utility that coordinates time updates
and VCR-like playback for other utilities like pmchart and pmval.

Instructions on building these tools can be found in doc/INSTALL.  Consult
http://oss.sgi.com/projects/pcp/ for additional details about these tools.


=== Planned for 2.0 ===

    - Movable charts (drag & drop)
    - Chart gadget (with Y-axis - pmgadgets-like)
    - Bar gadget (horizonal/vertical - pmgadgets/gmemusage/grosview-like)
    - LED gadget (pmgadgets-like)
    - Label gadget (pmgadgets-like)
    - Value gadget (new - optionally use QLCDNumber)
    - Extended pmchart view format 
	- chart positioning
	- gadget panels
	- "include <file>" syntax (for Overview view, and people
	  like Nigel generating their own 'composite' views)
	- support the pmgadgets configuration file syntax
    - Need to regenerate many screenshots (Tutorial/Manual) with
      whatever the final windows look like.


=== Wishlist TODO items ===

    - Merge Qwt 5.1 sources.
    - The Qt-based metrics class needs:
      o A hash for metric instance values instead of an array
	(to support delete, and better support of dynamic indoms)
    - pmtime should send a message to all clients on show/hide (except
      for the client that explicitly requested the show/hide, if there
      was one) - this would let the clients correctly track whether it
      is visible/not (pmchart displays this state in the Options menu,
      and uses that state to decide whether a hide/show is needed).
    - Extend pmdumptext to use an abstracted pmtime class for pmtime
      VCR control.
    - Extend pmdumptext to allow input to drive pmtime remotely (will
      need to allow SET message from clients at any time, not just on
      initial exchange) and use this to automate QA of pmtime.
    - Write automated QA for Save View (need a new command line option),
      then with -C and -c, open (multiple) views, save, then verify.
    - pmquery window initial sizing and resizing could use improvement.
    - pmview code released by SGI - needs porting work
	www.coin3d.org have an Inventor-compatible API, Qt bindings, and
	support Mac/Windows/Linux - looks ideal for this.
